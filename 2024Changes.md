# 2024 Changes

This website was created by [Giuseppe Barillari](https://barillari.me/) for the
2023/2024 Engineering Society. Since Giuseppe has graduated, I,
[Harry Boyd](https://hboyd.co.uk/), have taken on the job of maintaining the
website for the 2024/2024 Society. This document outlines the changes I that
need making to the website.

## Changes
